   - Bulk operations support

3. **Repository Access**
   - Methods:
     - `ListTeamRepos(org string, team string)`
     - `AddTeamRepo(org string, team string, repo string)`
     - `RemoveTeamRepo(org string, team string, repo string)`
   
   Features:
   - Granular repository access control
   - Inherited permissions through team hierarchy
   - Bulk repository management

### Nested Teams

1. **Hierarchy Management**
   - Method: `GetNestedTeams(org string, team string)`
   - Features:
     - Parent/child team relationships
     - Permission inheritance
     - Recursive access control
     - Efficient team structure traversal

## Validation and Security

1. **Role Validation**
   - Supported roles:
     - `member`: Basic organization membership
     - `admin`: Organization administration rights
   - Strict validation to prevent invalid roles
   - Case-sensitive validation

2. **Permission Validation**
   - Supported permissions:
     - `pull`: Read access
     - `push`: Write access
     - `admin`: Administrative access
     - `maintain`: Maintainer access
     - `triage`: Issue and PR management
   - Strict validation enforced
   - Case-sensitive checking

## Implementation Details

1. **Thread Safety**
   - All operations are thread-safe
   - Concurrent access support
   - Mutex protection for shared resources
   - Safe for multi-goroutine usage

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error types
   - Detailed error messages
   - Input validation errors
   - API error propagation
   - Network error handling

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Efficient data structures
   - Optimized API calls
   - Caching support
   - Batch operation capabilities

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Complete test coverage
   - Mock implementations
   - Edge case testing
   - Error condition verification

2. **Concurrent Testing**
   - Race condition checks
   - Parallel operation tests
   - Load testing scenarios

3. **Example Tests**
   - Comprehensive examples
   - Real-world usage patterns
   - Documentation through tests

## Integration

1. **API Compatibility**
   - GitHub API v3 compliance
   - Extensible interfaces
   - Mock testing support
   - Custom client support

2. **Error Handling**
   - GitHub-specific errors
   - Rate limiting handling
   - Network error recovery
