# Organization Management Package

## Overview
This package provides functionality for managing GitHub organizations, teams, members, and repository access.

## Test Coverage
The package includes comprehensive test coverage across multiple dimensions:

### Functional Testing
- Basic operations (service_test.go)
- Usage examples (example_test.go)

### Error Handling
- Error conditions (error_test.go)
- Input validation
- API error propagation

### Boundary Testing
- Zero values (boundary_test.go)
- Maximum values
- Special characters
- Invalid inputs

### Concurrency Testing
- Thread safety (mock_test.go)
- Race condition detection
- Parallel operations

### Coverage Goals
- Target: 95% code coverage
- Target: 95% test pass rate
- All critical paths tested
- All error conditions verified

## Running Tests
